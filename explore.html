    <h1>Spirituality</h1>
    <p>Spirituality involves the recognition of a feeling or sense or belief that there is
        something greater than myself, something more to being human than sensory
        experience, and that the greater whole of which we are part is cosmic or divine in
        nature.</p>
        <p>Spirituality means knowing that our lives have significance in a context beyond a
        mundane everyday existence at the level of biological needs that drive selfishness
        and aggression. It means knowing that we are a significant part of a purposeful
        unfolding of Life in our universe.</p>
        <p>Spirituality involves exploring certain universal themes â€“ love, compassion, altruism,
        life after death, wisdom and truth, with the knowledge that some people such as
        saints or enlightened individuals have achieved and manifested higher levels of
        development than the ordinary person. Aspiring to manifest the attributes of such
        inspirational examples often becomes an important part of the journey through life for
        spiritually inclined people</p>
